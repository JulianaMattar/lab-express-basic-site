    <h1>About Babou Dali</h1>

    <p>
      In the 1960's, the cat loving Dali acquired his favorite pet cat, an
      ocelot, which he named Babou. Dali took Babou everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>Rumor has it that Dali obtained Babou from a Colombian head of state.</p>

    <p>
      Babou sported a collar studded with precious gems and was kept on a leash,
      living an opulent life and travelling with Dali and accompanying him to
      restaurants. While an ordinary cat is usually much too shy to travel around with his or her owner, Babou would peacefully wear a leash and accompanied Dali just about everywhere.
    </p>

    <p>
      Babou and Dali visited a Manhatan restaurance once, where teh cat scared
      other dines. Dali is said to have remarked "Babou was nothing more than a
      normal cat which he had painted over in an op art design."
    </p>
    <p>
        Salvator Dali, one of history's most interesting artists, took funny pictures with his cat before it was cool.
